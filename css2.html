        <img src="Img/helt&tea.jpg" alt="h&t">
        <ol>
            <li>Can Help With Weight Loss</li>
            <p>Studies show that Ceylon green tea may help with weight loss. The most important set of compounds in green tea happen to be catechins, especially EGCG. Participants consuming green tea had shown significant reduction in their abdominal fat.</p>
            <li> Aids Diabetes Treatment</li>
            <p>Both forms of Ceylon tea, the black and the green variants, could work great in treating diabetes. The teas had blood sugar lowering effects and even cut the risk of diabetic cataracts. The catechins in Ceylon green tea may also improve serum insulin levels, thereby regulating blood glucose levels. This can be of great help to people with diabetes.</p>
            <li>Boosts Immunity</li>
            <p>The antioxidants in Ceylon green tea play a major role here. They act against free radicals and the resultant oxidative stress, thereby boosting immunity. The other polyphenols and flavonoids help boost the immune system.</p>
            <li>Can Prevent Kidney Stones</li>
            <p>Ceylon tea may cut down the risk of kidney stones. Most kidney stones are made of calcium oxalate. They occur when calcium accumulates in the urinary tract. Studies have found that green tea extract can bond with the calcium oxalate and make them form into a different shape – thereby making them less likely to clump and form stones.</p>
            <li>Can Combat Cancer</li>
            <p>Ceylon green tea catechins, especially EGCG, was found to play a beneficial role in the treatment of prostate hyperplasia (the initial stage of prostate cancer).And thanks to the excellent antioxidant content, Ceylon green tea can be considered one of the best cancer-fighting foods. The polyphenols in the tea prevent the growth and proliferation of tumors in multiple forms of cancer.</p>
