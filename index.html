        <h2>Story of Ceylone Tea.</h2>
        <p>Sri Lankan tea (known for generations as Ceylon Tea) carries behind it a heritage and success story like no other. The story of Ceylon tea begins over two hundred years ago, when the country was still a British colony. In 1824 a tea plant was brought to Ceylon by the British from China and was planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya for non-commercial purposes. Further experimental planting of tea had begun in 1839 with tea plants brought from Assam and Calcutta through the East India Company. <a href="https://www.srilankabusiness.com/blog/wonderful-history-of-ceylon-tea.html">Read more</a></p>
